Description: The aim of XINA is to determine which proteins 
	     exhibit similar patterns within and across experimental 
	     conditions, since proteins with co-abundance patterns may 
	     have common molecular functions. XINA imports multiple 
	     datasets, tags dataset in silico, and combines the data 
	     for subsequent subgrouping into multiple clusters. 
	     The result is a single output depicting the variation 
	     across all conditions. XINA, not only extracts coabundance 
	     profiles within and across experiments, but also 
	     incorporates protein-protein interaction databases and 
	     integrative resources such as KEGG to infer interactors 
	     and molecular functions, respectively, and produces 
	     intuitive graphical outputs.
